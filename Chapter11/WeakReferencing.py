# Weak references are used for referencing objects without preventing their garbage collection. This means that weak references allow an object to be referenced but do not "own" the object. If there are no strong references to an object (normal references that a program maintains to objects), the object can be garbage collected (i.e., its memory can be freed), 

import weakref, gc
class A:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    def __repr__(self):
        return str(self.value)

a = A(10)                   # create a reference
d = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()
d['primary'] = a            # does not create a reference
d['primary']                # fetch the object if it is still alive

del a                       # remove the one reference
gc.collect()                # run garbage collection right away

d['primary']                # entry was automatically removed

# The weakref.WeakValueDictionary used in the provided code is a dictionary that holds weak references to its values. When a value (referenced by a weak reference) is garbage collected, its entry in the dictionary is automatically removed. This behavior is particularly useful for caches and other structures where you don't want the caching mechanism to prevent objects from being garbage collected.
